# Multi-Instance Claude Hooks Analysis

## Current Architecture Issues

1. **Global Hooks**: Claude Code hooks apply globally to ALL instances
2. **No Instance Identification**: Hook environment variables don't include instance info
3. **Notification Ambiguity**: Can't tell which terminal triggered Stop/Notification events

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Enhanced Multi-Instance (Implemented Above) âœ… RECOMMENDED

**Approach**: Keep multi-terminal architecture, add instance awareness

**Implementation**:
- Pass instance ID/name via environment variables
- Update hook commands to use `$CLAUDE_INSTANCE_NAME`
- Track instance state in separate file

**Pros**:
- Minimal changes to existing architecture
- Maintains separate personalities per terminal
- Easy visual separation of different Claude contexts
- No need to refactor existing code

**Cons**:
- Still have multiple processes (more resource usage)
- Hooks remain global but now instance-aware

### Option 2: Single Instance with Subagents

**Approach**: Use one Claude terminal with subagent commands

**Implementation**:
```bash
# In single terminal
/subagent "architect" "Design the API structure"
/subagent "qa" "Review this code for issues"
```

**Pros**:
- Single process, less resource usage
- Hooks work naturally (only one instance)
- Aligns with Anthropic's recommendations for complex tasks

**Cons**:
- Lose visual separation of different contexts
- Need major refactoring of IDE
- Harder to track which "personality" is active
- All output in single terminal

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

**Approach**: Primary terminal + specialized subagents

**Implementation**:
- One main Claude terminal for general work
- Spawn subagents for specific tasks
- Track subagent status separately

**Pros**:
- Balance between resource usage and separation
- Can use SubagentStop hooks effectively

**Cons**:
- More complex to implement
- Still need instance tracking

## Recommendation: Option 1 (Enhanced Multi-Instance)

Your current architecture is good! The multi-terminal approach provides:
- Clear visual separation of contexts
- Ability to work on different problems simultaneously  
- Easy personality switching per terminal

The changes I implemented above solve the notification problem by:
1. Adding instance environment variables to each Claude process
2. Making hooks instance-aware with `$CLAUDE_INSTANCE_NAME`
3. Providing better notification messages showing which terminal finished

## Testing the Solution

1. Clear existing hooks:
```bash
rm ~/.claude/settings.json
```

2. Add the new instance-aware hooks via the IDE

3. Start multiple Claude terminals with different names

4. Test that notifications show the correct terminal name

## Future Enhancements

1. **Visual Indicators**: Add "thinking" or "responding" indicators per terminal
2. **Instance-Specific Hooks**: Allow hooks to be configured per terminal
3. **Smart Routing**: Route certain file types to specific personalities automatically
4. **Session Persistence**: Save terminal output per instance

## Why Not Subagents?

While Anthropic recommends subagents for complex problems, your use case is different:
- You want persistent, separate contexts (architect vs QA vs developer)
- Visual separation helps manage multiple concurrent tasks
- Each terminal can maintain its own conversation history

Subagents are better for:
- Temporary specialized tasks within a single context
- Verification or research steps
- When you need results back in the main conversation

Your multi-terminal approach is better for:
- Long-running separate contexts
- Parallel development with different focuses
- Visual organization of work
