## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (22.x LTS recommended)
- Git
- Claude Code CLI installed globally
- A GitHub account

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/clode-studio.git
cd clode-studio

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/haidar-ali/clode-studio.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile Electron TypeScript
npm run electron:compile

# Start development
npm run electron:dev
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Stay updated with upstream**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

3. **Make changes and test**:
   ```bash
   # Run in dev mode
   npm run electron:dev
   
   # Run type checking
   npm run typecheck
   
   # Run linting
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Define interfaces for component props
- Use proper typing for Electron IPC

### Vue 3 Composition API

- Use `<script setup>` syntax for components
- Organize composables in `/composables`
- Keep components small and focused
- Use Pinia for state management

### File Organization

```
clode-studio/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/       # Vue components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ editor/      # Editor-related components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ kanban/      # Kanban board components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ terminal/    # Terminal components
â”œâ”€â”€ stores/          # Pinia stores
â”œâ”€â”€ composables/     # Vue composables
â”œâ”€â”€ electron/        # Electron main process
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/           # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ types/           # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `TaskBoard.vue`)
- **Composables**: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useClaudeInstance.ts`)
- **Stores**: camelCase with 'Store' suffix (e.g., `claudeStore.ts`)
- **Files**: kebab-case for non-components (e.g., `file-utils.ts`)

### Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Always handle errors gracefully
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Log errors appropriately

2. **Performance**:
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders
   - Use `computed` and `watch` efficiently
   - Clean up event listeners and intervals

3. **Electron Security**:
   - Use contextBridge for IPC
   - Validate all inputs from renderer
   - Avoid using `nodeIntegration: true`

4. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for new features
   - Ensure existing tests pass
   - Test edge cases

## Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Update user guides in `/docs` when changing functionality
- Include examples for new features
